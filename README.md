To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xhide341/lcup-poc
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd lcup-poc
    ```
3.  Install dependencies using pnpm:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Familiarized myself with Vue, especially with the Router feature.
- Learned SASS/SCSS, I find the class nesting, variable naming, and mixins very useful.

## 📝 Development Notes

- I would love to use vue again but this time with a framework like Nuxt.
- SASS/SCSS is an awesome experience, though I still find tailwind easier to use.
- Depending on the project needs, SASS is way better than vanilla css especially if required with more control.
