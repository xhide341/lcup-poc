## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Familiriazed myself with Vue, especially with the RouterView feature.
- Learned SASS/SCSS, I find the class nesting, variable naming, and mixins very useful.

## 📝 Development Notes

- I would love to use vue again but this time with a framework like Nuxt.
- SASS/SCSS is an awesome experience, though I still find tailwind easier to use.
- Depending on the project needs, SASS is way better than vanilla css especially if required with more control.
